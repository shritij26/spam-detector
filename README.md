# üì± SMS Spam Classifier (Logistic Regression)

This project is a **basic machine learning application** that detects whether a given SMS message is **spam or not spam** (ham) using **Logistic Regression**.

## üß† What I Learned

- Concepts like:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature extraction (TF-IDF)
  - Train-test split
  - Model training with logistic regression
  - Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall)
- Saving & loading models using `joblib`
