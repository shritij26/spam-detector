# üì± SMS Spam Classifier (Logistic Regression)

This project is a **basic machine learning application** that detects whether a given SMS message is **spam or not spam** (ham) using **Logistic Regression**.

## üß† What I Learned

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handling missing values
  - Removing duplicates
  - Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.)

- **Feature Extraction**
  - Tokenization
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency) vectorization

- **Data Splitting**
  - Train-Test split to evaluate model performance on unseen data

- **Model Training**
  - Logistic Regression for binary classification (spam vs. ham)
  - Use of scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` model

- **Model Evaluation**
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Precision, recall, and F1-score
  - Classification report
    
- Saving & loading models using `joblib`
